## Activity6

Group4 - This is Activity6 Unity Tutorial group project

My teammate and I decided to divide 20 tutorials in half. I conducted a tutorial from steps 1 to 10. It was more challenging to handle GitHub than to make a game using Unity. Taking this opportunity to learn about GitHub, I think it will be helpful for the upcoming final assignment. 👩🏻‍💻
